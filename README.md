Information Visualization Measurement and Evaluation
=======

This resource gives a summary of information visualization in the following parts: 

- An overview meant for researchers outside the visualization field, 
- approaches to measurement and evaluation (or lack and need of such), 
- and a proposed visualization task in the traffic domain

##What is visualization?

> "Graphics is the visual means of resolving logical problems" - Jacques Bertin

Visualization has become a loaded word.

Chen et al. define visualization as:

> "__Visualization__ is a study of transformation from data to visual representations in order to facilitate effective and efficient cognitive processes in performing tasks involving data."

There are many types of visualizations, however, I'll focus on _computer supported data visualization_, which features data and computers. 

## Knowledge vs information 

Bertin (1981) distinguishes between graphics used for communication and graphics leveraged in processing data. The process of solving a problem involves distinct types of graphics, or visualizations. __Knowledge visualizations__ communicate the answers discovered through __information visualizations__. Information visualizations are visual analytic tools for exploring and extracting patterns from abstract data. 

We use knowledge visualization to communicate ideas:

And we use (sometimes cryptic) information visualization to discover patterns in data:

In addition to focusing on _computer supported data visualization_, I will also focus on _information visualization_. (Although some concepts may also apply to knowledge visualization)

##Why information visualization is important

The display of data is a potentially powerful tool for data analysis. Visualization allows for the thorough exploration of the structure of data (Cleveland 1994). Many techniques of data analysis, which leverage data reduction - reduce the data to a handful of statistics. On the other hand, data visualization is a form of data analysis that can be leveraged to "convey the wealth of information that exists in data" (Cleveland 1994). 

The use of data visualization tools also allows for the encounter or surprises of the data, "yielding conclusions to questions not originally asked" (Cleveland 1994).
