#Possible approach
Write about where visualization fits in a data science task

- Whole software package or single visualization
- Need to define the problems the datasets should be solving
	- Clean data should be used
	- emulate real world application
- Can borrow from the evaluation of new visualization techniques (Forsell and Cooper 2014)

- Usability study that uses both theory and experimentation to validate.

- Heuristic review
- measured response experiments
- interviews
