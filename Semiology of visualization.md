#Semiology of visualization

> "Everything points to the conclusion that the phrase 'the language of art' is more than a loose metaphor, that even to describe the visible world in images we need a developed system of schemata" \- E. H. Gombrich, _Art and Illustion, 1959_

Semiology is the creation of meaningful communication. Visualization is a communication tool that leverages the powerful visual perceptive capabilities of the human mind. 

Below are descriptions of some semiological components of visualization. 

## The Data

Data lies at the center of visualization. Data can be in a multitude of formats, for example: text, image, sound or video.

Data values can be separated into three categories (Card and Mackinlay 1997):

- __Nominal__: Only = or â‰  to other values
- __Ordered__: Follows a < relation
- __Quantitative__: Can be processed by arithmetic

The best type of visualization method for data will vary depending on these categories and other factors.

Shneiderman defines seven data types:

[Dimensional]
- __1-dimensional__: Linear data types, such as lists
- __2-dimensional__: Planar, map data 
- __3-dimensional__: Volume, real world objects
- __Multidimensional__: n attributes become points in n-dimensional space

[Relational]
- __Tree__: Hierarchies, parent nodes with children nodes
- __Network__: Non-hierarchical relationships among items

Which can be distilled down to two overarching data types (__network__ and __dimensional__). Data can also be a mixture of these types.

Shneiderman (1996)also defines seven tasks to accompany these data types:

- __Overview__
- __Zoom__
- __Filter__ 
- __Details on demand__
- __Relate__
- __History__
- __Extract__

##Visualization vocabulary

Card and Mackinlay (1997) introduce an visual vocabulary to describe visualization. 

__Marks__: Point, line, area, surface, volume

__Controlled Processing of Graphical Features__: Process abstract encodings (text, etc.)

__Automatically Processing of Graphical Features__: Process visual properties (position, color, etc.)

- __Retinal encodings__: Color, size shape, gray-level, orientation, texture, connection, enclosure
- __Position__: X, Y, Z, T (3D space plus time)

The vocabulary builds upon previous work by Bertin (1983) and Mackinlay (1986).

Visualizations establish mappings between data and the visual vocabulary described above (Card and Mackinlay).
